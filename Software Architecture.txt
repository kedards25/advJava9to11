Any software can be divided into 3 main parts
	Design=>Presentation Logic->PL
	Logic/Code=>Bussiness Logic->BL
	Db	=>Data Layer->DL

Single/one Tier Architecture
	PL	BL	DL 
	on one machine/computer
		Pro's
			Ease of access
			Cost Efficient
			Quick Response ->no need of network
			Less Maintainance

		Con's
			Less Secure
			Load on single machine leads to poor performance
			No backup facility in case of system crash
			Single user oriented
Two Tier Architecture

	PL+BL		DL
	client		Server
	Fat Client 	Thin Server

	PL		BL+DL
	Thin Client	Fat Server

		Pro's
			Less load
			More Secure
			backup facility
			multi-user oriented
		
		Con's
			network dependency
			more maintainance cost
			lag in response
			in case of update/upgrade in logic
				each client has to be visited separately

Three Tier Architecture
	PL	BL	DL
		Pro's
			Load equally divided on machines
					
		Con's
			even small request needs to be handled on server side
			causing reloading of web page
N-Tier Architecture
	PL		BL		DL
	 	AJAX		disc db
	AJAX=>helps in partial page reloading
